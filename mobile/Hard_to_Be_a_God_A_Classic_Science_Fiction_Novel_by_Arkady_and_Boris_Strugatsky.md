The novel is divided into three parts, each corresponding to a different stage of Rumata's mission and his personal transformation. In the first part, Rumata tries to find and rescue Budach from Don Reba's clutches, while also helping some local intellectuals and artists who are persecuted by the regime. He meets Dona Okana, a beautiful and rebellious noblewoman who becomes his lover, and Don Kondor, a cynical and disillusioned observer who has lost faith in his mission. Rumata also encounters Don Reba himself, a charismatic and ruthless leader who sees Rumata as a rival and a threat.
 
In the second part, Rumata is captured by Don Reba's men and tortured in his castle. He manages to escape with the help of Okana and Kondor, but not before witnessing the horrors of Don Reba's dungeons and laboratories, where he experiments on human beings and animals. Rumata also learns that Budach has been killed by Don Reba, who used his knowledge to create a deadly plague that he plans to unleash on the kingdom. Rumata decides to break his oath and kill Don Reba, but he is stopped by Pashka, who has arrived from Irukan with a group of rebels. Pashka tells Rumata that they have a plan to overthrow Don Reba peacefully and establish a new government.
 
In the third part, Rumata joins Pashka's rebellion and infiltrates the capital city of Arkanar with a fake identity. He hopes to find Okana, who has been kidnapped by Don Reba's agents, and to stop the plague from spreading. However, he soon realizes that Pashka's plan is doomed to fail, as the rebels are outnumbered and outmatched by Don Reba's army and secret police. Rumata also discovers that Pashka has been corrupted by his power and ambition, and that he intends to become the new dictator of Arkanar. Rumata faces a final confrontation with Don Reba and Pashka, in which he has to choose between his loyalty to his mission and his love for Okana.
